## Todo

- write guide on dedicated terraform user creation to limit scope from root compartment
    - second scripts for this?
- is a private key upload even neccessary??
    - if yes, Vault SSH Secrets Engine?
- update docs with a new set of private keys (named specifically for terraform/oci)
- need fine-grained permissions on oci api/ssh keys
- `oci_core_public_ip` should be idempotent
- SSH private key is needed by Ansible... can we use a collection for vault to handle this better?
    - temp file isn't practical
- Logging to track of all access attempts and successful connections via SSH?
    - restrict the gateway/nsg ssh access to a whitelist
    - cloudflare tunnel? 
- oci_core_public_ip.ignore_changes could be more specific
