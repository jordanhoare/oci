Setting up Traefik as an ingress controller within the K3s cluster allows you to manage how incoming traffic is routed to your services. 

1. Traefik serves as an ingress controller, which means it manages how external traffic from the internet or other sources is routed to various services running in your Kubernetes cluster. It listens to incoming requests and routes them based on rules defined in Kubernetes ingress resources.

2. K3s comes with Traefik installed by default as the ingress controller. However, if you need to customize its configuration, you can modify it or install a different version of Traefik.

To Verify or Modify Traefik Installation:

Check if Traefik is Running:
    Run kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system to see if Traefik pods are running.

Customizing Traefik:
    You can override the default configuration by editing the HelmChart configuration:

o verify that your worker nodes are correctly exposing the Traefik dashboard service, you can follow these steps:
1. Check the Traefik Deployment and Service

First, ensure that the Traefik deployment and service are running as expected.

    Check the Traefik Deployment:

    bash

kubectl get deployments -n kube-system

Look for the Traefik deployment in the output. Ensure that it shows the desired number of replicas and that they are all available.

Check the Traefik Service:

bash

    kubectl get service traefik -n kube-system

    This command will show you the service details, including the ports that are exposed and the ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer IP assigned to the service.

2. Verify the NodePort

If the Traefik service is exposed as a NodePort, you can check which port is being used:

    Run the following command to get the details of the Traefik service:

    bash

kubectl describe service traefik -n kube-system

Look for the NodePort in the output under the Ports section. This will tell you which port on the worker nodes is being used to expose the Traefik service.
